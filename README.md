# react-flexbox-grid-example

###Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install && npm start`
3. Visit `0.0.0.0:8080` in your browser


    ###Note 

    Using the above method, I was unable to get this to install properly on my machine and I followed some steps from another thread on Github. So the contribution is more @VinayKrMittal .

    1. Delete your node_modules folder^^
    2. Remove gulp-sass from your package.json file
    3. Remove node-sass from your package.json file (if you have it in there)
    4. Run npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
    5. npm install && npm start



    ^^I should also note at points it would throw an error before fully installing the node_modules so I had to remove the directory from the terminal with:
    
    rm -r node_modules
